# Deep Learning

## Introduction

- Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. These models operate on massive datasets and learn by extracting hierarchical features from data.

### Why is it Called "Deep"?

The term "Deep" in Deep Learning refers to the multiple layers in artificial neural networks. These layers include:

- **Input Layers**: Receive raw data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Extract different features from the data.
- **Output Layers**: Provide final predictions or classifications.

Each layer in a deep learning model extracts different levels of features:

- **Top Layers**: Capture simple patterns (e.g., edges in images).
- **Deeper Layers**: Capture more complex patterns (e.g., shapes and objects).

### Key Characteristics of Deep Learning

- **Subset of Machine Learning**: Based on artificial neural networks.
- **Hierarchical Learning**: Learns from raw input to complex features.
- **Multiple Layers**: Consists of input, hidden, and output layers.
- **Large Datasets**: Requires massive datasets for effective training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Automates the process of learning patterns from data.

6. **Neurons**:
    
    - The human brain consists of approximately 86 billion neurons.
    - Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system.
7. **Connections**:
    
    - Neurons are connected to thousands of other neurons via <font color="#ffff00">axons</font>.
    - Axons transmit electrical signals to other neurons.
8. **Input Reception**:
    
    - <font color="#ffff00">Dendrites</font> receive stimuli from the external environment or sensory organs.
    - Dendrites function as the "input receivers" of the neuron.
9. **Electric Impulses**:
    
    - Inputs create electrical impulses called action potentials.
    - These impulses propagate through the neural network rapidly.
10. **Signal Transmission**:
    
    - A neuron can transmit signals to another neuron for further processing.
    - If the stimulus is weak, the neuron may not transmit the signal forward.

### **How Backpropagation Works**
![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e82173e5-8551-4f07-9627-c793d72ee420)

26. **Forward Propagation:**
    
    - Inputs pass through the network layer by layer.
    - The output is compared to the actual label, and an error (loss) is calculated.
27. **Error Calculation:**
    
    - The difference between the predicted output and the actual output is measured using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy Loss).
28. **Backward Propagation:**
    
    - The **gradient** of the loss function is computed with respect to each weight.
    - This is done using the **chain rule of calculus**.
    - The gradients help determine how much to adjust each weight to reduce the loss.
29. **Weight Updates:**
    
    - Weights are updated using **Gradient Descent** (or variants like Adam, RMSprop).
    - This process continues until the model reaches optimal performance.

### **Key Components of Backpropagation**

- **Loss Function:** Measures how far the model‚Äôs prediction is from the true output.
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm:** Optimizes weights based on gradients.
- **Learning Rate:** Controls the step size of weight updates.
