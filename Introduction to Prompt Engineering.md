# üöÄ Advanced Techniques in Prompt Engineering

Using advanced **prompting techniques** improves a model's ability to generalize, reason, and adapt to complex tasks.


|**Technique**|**Description**|**Example**|**Why Use It?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Zero-Shot Prompting**|No examples provided; model infers task from instruction alone.|_Prompt:_ "Classify text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative." _Text:_ "The game is okay." _Output:_ "Neutral."|- Works without labeled data - Eliminates need for retraining - Good for broad tasks|
|**Few-Shot Prompting**|Provides a few labeled examples to guide the model.|_Text:_ "The furniture is small." _Classification:_ "Neutral." _Text:_ "That shot selection was awful." _Classification:_ "Negative."|- More precise than zero-shot - Helps with complex tasks - Useful in classification, translation|
|**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**|Breaks down reasoning into step-by-step intermediate steps.|_Q:_ "A store sells apples at ‚Çπ5 each. A customer buys 4 apples and pays ‚Çπ50. How much change?" _Step-by-step reasoning:_ Calculates cost, subtracts from total, outputs ‚Çπ30.|- Improves logical reasoning - Useful for math & multi-step tasks - Helps in QA & coding|
|**Few-Shot with In-Context Learning**|Model learns from examples inside the prompt.|_English:_ "Hello" ‚Üí _French:_ "Bonjour" _English:_ "How are you?" ‚Üí _French:_ "Comment √ßa va?"|- Adapts to domain-specific tasks - Useful for structured transformations|

---

### **üîπ 1. Zero-Shot Prompting**

‚úÖ **No prior examples are given; the model must infer the task from the instruction alone.**

- **Example (Sentiment Analysis):**
    - **Prompt:** _"Classify the following text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative."_
    - **Text:** _"The game is okay."_
    - **Output:** _"Neutral."_

üîç **Why Use Zero-Shot Prompting?**

- Useful when **no labeled data** is available.
- Eliminates the need for extensive training on new categories.
- Works well for broad tasks like **text classification, summarization, or question answering**.

---

### **üîπ 2. Few-Shot Prompting**

‚úÖ **Provides a few labeled examples (shots) to guide the model‚Äôs response.**

- **Example (Sentiment Analysis with Few Shots):**
    
    ```
    Text: Today the weather is fantastic  
    Classification: Pos  
    Text: The furniture is small.  
    Classification: Neu  
    Text: I don't like your attitude.  
    Classification: Neg  
    Text: That shot selection was awful.  
    Classification:
    ```
    
    **Model Output ‚Üí** _"Negative."_
    

üîç **Why Use Few-Shot Prompting?**
	- **More precise than zero-shot** since examples guide the model.
	- Helps models **understand complex or nuanced tasks** without retraining.
	- Works well in **translation, classification, and structured output generation**.

---

### **üîπ 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

‚úÖ **Breaks down complex reasoning into intermediate steps.**

- Example (Math Problem Solving):
    
    ```
    Q: A store sells apples at ‚Çπ5 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and pays with a ‚Çπ50 note, how much change do they get?  
    ```
    
    **Zero-Shot Prompt Output:** _"‚Çπ30."_ (Incorrect)
    
    **Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**
    
    ```C
    Let's break it down step by step:  
    - Each apple costs ‚Çπ5.  
    - 4 apples cost 4 √ó ‚Çπ5 = ‚Çπ20.  
    - The customer paid ‚Çπ50.  
    - Change = ‚Çπ50 - ‚Çπ20 = ‚Çπ30.  
    ```
    
    **Final Answer ‚Üí ‚Çπ30.**
    

üîç **Why Use Chain-of-Thought?**
	- Helps with **logical reasoning and step-by-step problem-solving**.
	- Enhances model performance in **math, reasoning, and multi-step tasks**.
	- Especially effective in **complex question-answering and coding tasks**.

---

### **üîπ 4. Few-Shot Prompting with In-Context Learning**

‚úÖ **The model "learns" from examples within the prompt itself without fine-tuning.**

- Example (Translation Task):
    
    ```
    English: Hello  
    French: Bonjour  
    English: Good morning  
    French: Bonjour  
    English: How are you?  
    French:
    ```
    
    **Model Output ‚Üí** _"Comment √ßa va?"_

üîç **Why Use Few-Shot with In-Context Learning?**
	- Helps models adapt to **domain-specific tasks** quickly.
	- Works well for **structured data transformations** (e.g., **parsing, translations, summarization**).

---
